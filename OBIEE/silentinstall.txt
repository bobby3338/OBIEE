GOAL
On Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition 12.2.1.x version,

How to perform silent installation of OBIEE 12c? 

SOLUTION
This document demonstrates the steps to perform Silent Installation of OBIEE 12c.

Why Silent Installation is required?

When OBIEE 12c is being installed on Linux box where GUI access has not been given then go for Silent Installation i.e., install using command lines via PUTTY.

This installation is more complicated and it requires "Response Files" of each component for:

Weblogic Installation
OBIEE Installation
OBIEE Configuration.
Where Softwares can be download:
Open the link: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi/downloads/default-3237328.html

Download the listed softwares [For e.g., Software details given for 12.2.1.2 Release].

WebLogic Server (fmw_12.2.1.2.0_infrastructure_Disk1_1of1.zip)
Oracle Business Intelligence 12c (fmw_12.2.1.2.0_bi_linux64_Disk1_1of2.zip and fmw_12.2.1.2.0_bi_linux64_Disk1_2of2.zip)
Response Files:
Once downloaded all the required softwares, prepare the following response files before installation.

Weblogic response file
OBIEE response file
Config response file
The response files attached here are necessary for the silent installation. Change values according to the environment which are in bold.

In this silent installation, RCU is installed as part of the OBIEE configuration.
Silent Installation
Oracle Inventory Location:   inventory_loc=/../oraInventory

Step 1 - Unzip Softwares
Make sure all the response file are ready. 'Unzip' all the software in a single directory.

Step 2 - Environment Variables
Set the below Environment variables before starting installation.  Make sure all set properly. 

export MW_HOME=/../ORACLE/Middleware

export WLS_HOME=$MW_HOME/wlserver

export WL_HOME=$WLS_HOME

export DOMAIN_HOME=$MW_HOME/user_projects/domains/bi

export JAVA_HOME=/../jdk1.8.0_121

export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

export ORACLE_HOME=<Path of Oracle_Home>

Step 3 - Installation
Perform the installation in the following sequence.

Install WebLogic in silent mode:
Go to the directory where all softwares are unzipped. Run the following command:

-bash-4.2$ java -jar fmw_12.2.1.2.0_infrastructure.jar -silent -responseFile /apps/../Weblogic.rsp -invPtrLoc /../../OraInst.loc
Once the installation started, will receive the following response on the screen.

Launcher log file is /tmp/OraInstall2017-05-10_11-44-25AM/launcher2017-05-10_11-44-25AM.log.

The installation of bi_platform 12.2.1.2.0 completed successfully.

Logs successfully copied to /../../ORACLE/oraInventory/logs.

Configure OBIEE in silent mode:
Once the installation succeeded, go to the directory: <MIDDLEWARE_HOME>/bi/bin.

Run the configuration script by using the command:

./config.sh -silent -responseFile /../../ORACLE/Middleware/bi/bin/biconfig.rsp -invPtrLoc /../../OraInst.loc
Once the configuration is successfully completed, all servers will be in "RUNNING" status.

Note: RCU password should have Alphabets, Numbers. Also should have "Special Characters" like ‘#’.

Validation:
Test the application by opening Console, EM, Analytics and XMLPServer URLs.
